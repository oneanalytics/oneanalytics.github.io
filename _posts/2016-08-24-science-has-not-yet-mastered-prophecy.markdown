<p>Whether or not your business card has “Digital” as part of you title, take note that 2017 is a watershed moment for marketers. Gartner already stated that this year CMO’s will spend more on IT than CIO’s.</p>

<p>Indonesia’s digital and mobile internet ad growth is one of the highest in the world (65% YoY growth). In 2017, 15% of marketing spend is going to digital, with a third of it going to mobile internet ads.</p>

<p>None of this comes as a surprise to digital-first companies, but for verticals that are firmly attached to their offline roots, 2017 may be the last chance you get to break out of the “will-we, won’t-we” cycle and jump all in into digital.</p>

<p>Banks, I’m looking at you. Every year in the last 5 years, banks have said “This is the year we’ll go digital!” only to lose momentum halfway. This is reflected in search trends</p>

<p>In the meantime, unlikely competitors are popping up to challenge the old guards. Banks are now competing with mobile service providers and software startups for their customers money. These challengers are not thinking “digital banking”, they’re thinking “fintech”</p>

<p>We already know what will happen if things continue as it is. Once upon a time, Nokia (ah, you know if it features Nokia, it’s going to be a cautionary tale) wanted some of the mobile money action. The company decided to try it out in India. For three years, Nokia researched and built partnerships with banks there. In December 2011, Nokia Money finally launched. In March 2012, the service was shut down.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, 3 years of setting up for a product that lasted for only 3 months. Compare this to the numerous fintech startups in India that mushroomed out of nowhere around the same time-- Paytm, Freecharge, MobiKwik just to name a few. These startups didn’t have the luxury to dawdle. It was sink or swim for them from the get-go.</p>

<p>So, enough with the toe-dipping, it’s time dive in.</p>

<h2>“We’ve gone digital, and we’re doing … great, maybe?”</h2>

<p>You want to know if you’re spending the right amount of money on the right campaigns? No problem.</p>

<p>You want to know which campaigns are driving the most converting traffic? Sure, do you want that parsed by demographic profiles or likelihood of repeat purchase?</p>

<span>To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>

<p>You want to know what your competitors are up to?  Heck, we can tell you which of their content is actually generating traffic, where their customers are coming from, and where they go afterwards.</p>

<p>When everything is measurable and there’s data on virtually everything, business intelligence turns from “How do we get more information?” to “How do we focus on information that matters?”</p>

<p>Those in leadership positions need to be able to translate business objectives into measurable goals, guide their teams in turning business goals to analytic goals, and then drive the teams to achieve those goals. </p>

<p>These seem like simple transitions, yet surprisingly, we’ve run into plenty of companies who’ve dropped the ball midway.  </p>

<p>We’ve ran into companies who’ve let analytic goals run ahead and shape business goals.  </p>

<p>We’ve ran into companies without specific business objectives other than, “Everyone else has gone digital. We don’t want to be left behind!”  </p>

<p>
We’ve ran into companies that insisted that they have analytic tools already set up, but don’t even have Goals set up on their Google Analytics. </p>

<p>Our team has helped clients with everything from the straightforward on-site user behaviour analysis to fancy cross-device attribution modeling, but even if you’re not about to hire a data analytics consultancy, you can already get a lot of insights if you have Goals set up. </p>

<p>Using Google Analytics without setting up Goals is like trying to win a race without tying up your laces. It’s just one of those things</p>

<h2>Actionable vs Vanity Metrics</h2>

<p>Registered users, downloads, and raw pageviews are vanity metrics. Active users, engagement, the cost of getting new customers, and ultimately revenues and profits are more actionable metrics.</p>

<p>Eric Reis first wrote about the dangers of vanity metrics almost a decade ago, yet digital marketers still lose sleep over metrics that only looks good on paper. </p>

<p>Why? Not because they don’t know any better. </p>

<p>It’s because vanity metrics provide easy ways to make us feel good. Or, in the case of more traditional companies, vanity metrics provide easy ways make our boss feel good. (“Look at all these visitors!”)</p>

<p>Corporate ego always has a part in Big Company life (why else would a digital bank product aimed at Gen Z put a full size ad on a newspaper - when was the last time you’ve seen a teenager reading newspaper?) but maybe your organisation is the exception.</p>

<p>If yours IS the exception, then you need to set up a dashboard that focuses on relevant actionable metrics and filter out all the noise.</p>

<p>If yours is NOT the exception (it’s okay, a little ego can be healthy), then it’s okay to be pragmatic. Why not set up an actionable metrics dashboard, plus another one that has all the feel good metrics inside? </p>

<p>Setting up custom dashboards start off simple. There are tons of templates just a Google search away.  The tough part is making sure you’re measuring what’s most relevant to you.  And yes, it can get more complex as you get more sophisticated with your segmentations and analysis.</p>

<p>
You’d also want to make sure that the data you’re gathering is clean.  Setting up filters is a good way to start.  You can filter out internal traffic and sessions coming from develop IP (important for smaller companies). You can filter out traffic coming from irrelevant geographical sources, self-referral traffic, organic spam, and much more.</p>

<h2>The Why, The Will, and The Way</h2>

<p>Non-digital companies that embraced digital early on wanted to win the race.  Non-digital companies that are late to the game are doing it because they want to survive.  No matter the motivation, at the end of the day it’s up to leaders and decision makers in organisations to point towards the direction they want to go<p>

<p>To reiterate, it’s not the tools, the consultant, or the budget that matters; it’s YOU the leader in your company. Your Why is clear. Your Way is too (or if it isn’t, give us a call). So, Will you?</p>
